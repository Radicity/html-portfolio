    Baby, if you connect with me <br>
    I'm just like your high speed cable <br>
    Even if you gotta fly <br>
    To where they drive, on the passenger side <br>
    I'll be the like the Autobahn <br>
    When you get on, you won't know how to let go <br>
    Browsing won't do <br>
    You got to click right here, come find me <br>
    I'll assure you <br>
    The places you've never been, I'll take you <br>
    I'm a world wide woman, WWW <br>

    You know I'm the type of girl <br>
    I want love, like any world wide woman would need <br>
    I know you think that can't be <br>
    Still got sensitivity <br>
    In my world, it's hard to get authenticity <br>
    But you feel so damn real to me <br>
    Come take the lead <br>
    Enjoy this world with me <br>
    I'm a world wide woman, WWW <br>
    You can log on anywhere, your girl can take you there <br>

<h4>Lyrics:</h4>
<p>Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess <br>
    Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh <br>
    I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin') <br>
    I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces <br>
    My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana <br>
    You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama <br>
    I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros <br>
    I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils <br>
    Earned all this money but they never take the country out me <br>
    I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag <br>
    I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow-bone it <br>
    I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it <br>
    I twirl on them haters, albino alligators <br>
    El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser <br>
    Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard) <br>
    Get what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star) <br>
    Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay <br>
    Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay <br>
    Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay <br>
    Prove to me you got some coordination, cause I slay <br>
    Slay trick, or you get eliminated <br>
    When he f-k me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay <br>
    When he f-k me good I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay <br>
    If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, cause I slay <br>
    Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, cause I slay <br>
    I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay <br>
    I might get your song played on the radio station, cause I slay <br>
    You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, cause I slay <br>
    I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making <br>
    I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow-bone it <br>
    I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it <br>
    I twirl on my haters, albino alligators <br>
    El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser <br>
    Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard) <br>
    Take what's mine (take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star) <br>
    Cause I slay (slay), I slay (hey), I slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    All day (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    We gon' slay (slay), gon' slay (okay), we slay (okay), I slay (okay) <br>
    I slay (okay), okay (okay), I slay (okay), okay, okay, okay, okay <br>
    Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay <br>
    Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, cause I slay <br>
    Prove to me you got some coordination, cause I slay <br>
    Slay trick, or you get eliminated
    Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, I slay <br>
    Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation <br>
